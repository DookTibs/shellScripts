# shell script that produces a summary report of all the defined 
# endpoints in DRAGON Online. When tracing down a problem can
# be used to quickly find the relevant controller (and from finding
# the source for that, the template it uses, services it calls, etc.)
#
# by default prints things as it finds them. Useful ways to use it:
#
# endpointSummary.sh
# endpointSummary.sh | sort
# endpointSummary.sh | grep dashboard
#
# this uses a file called "annotationReportCache" that contains the names of
# all files in the codebase that include the @RequestMapping directive.
# This doesn't change all that often, so I leave that file lying around. If you
# delete it (it lives in DRAGON_HOME) this script will recreate it.
